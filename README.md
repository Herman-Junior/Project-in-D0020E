Integrating Sensor and Audio Data Using a Relational Database System
## Project goals and Background
In engineering systems collecting and managing data from various sensors and devices is essential for monitoring performance detecting patterns and supporting decision making
Different types of data such as environmental measurements audio recordings and sensor outputs may be generated at the same time but stored separately
Without an efficient way to organize and relate these datasets valuable insights can be lost

This project focuses on designing and implementing a database system capable of storing organizing and linking heterogeneous data sources
The data includes audio recordings measurements from a weather station such as temperature wind speed and air pressure and humidity sensor readings

The main goals are to design the EER diagram manage audio and sensor data relate datasets captured at the same time enable queries and downloads based on time or filters and document the full implementation process

A key example is retrieving humidity and weather information for the exact time period when an audio file was recorded
This requires a suitable database schema user interfaces and consistent linking between related datasets.
